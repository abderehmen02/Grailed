           <span className="font-bold"> Identity and Compliance Information, </span>  including name, birthdate, address, phone number, email address, bank account information, government ID number and copies of government ID or tax documents, along with a selfie image. We may use data collection and verification services provided by a third-party provider, Persona, to collect and verify such information in order to comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and abuse. Persona may use a combination of machine-learning tools and optical scans to authenticate your identity document, and may use facial recognition technology to produce a unique biometric identifier based on facial geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document you provided to determine the likelihood that the images are a "match." We do not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images. It is generated and held by Persona until we inform them that the biometric identifier is no longer needed for the purposes described in this paragraph and must be destroyed. For identity verification and security purposes, we will have access to the selfie image and will receive the information extracted from the scan of the government ID document as well as the results of the identity verification process. We may use this process and associated information to verify your identity, authenticate your identity documents, comply with legal obligations and protect against fraud and misrepresentation. We do not use, disclose or retain your biometric information for any other commercial purpose. Our third-party provider, Persona, processes this information on our behalf strictly in accordance with our contractual agreements. For more information on Persona's data processing practices, please see Persona's Privacy Policy (available here).
